If you haven't already, be sure to download and install [Github for Mac](https://mac.github.com/). You will need OSX 10.9 or above. 

This guide will walk you through how to check out a project using GitHub for Mac, how to make changes to the project and how to check those changes back in. Following the directions below will ensure that there's little danger of overwriting each others changes and breaking the site. 

The process is diagramed below. We're using a well established branching and pull-request workflow. Learn what that means here: <https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/>.

### Cloning (Downloading a project)

1. Open GitHub for Mac. If you don't already have the new ISP project on your computer, you'll need to clone it. If you already have the project showing up, skip to [Making a Branch](#making-a-branch--making-edits)

2. Hit the clone tab.

4. Navigate to your user folder (above Documents, Pictures, etc.). Create an ISP folder if it doesnt exist. Enter this folder and click `clone`.

5. The project now lives on your computer, but you'll still need to run the install process; see README.md to complete that. When you're all installed, be sure to make a new branch before making edits, as described in the next section.

### Making a branch / Making edits

1. If you haven't freshly cloned the project, hit "sync" (1) to make sure the project is up to date (others working on the project can make commits at any time -- you'll want to make sure you always have the most updated version of the project). Now you're ready to make a branch and make changes on it. Click on "master" (2).

2. Pick a specific name for your branch and create one.

Now you can open and edit files in your project using your favorite editor.

3. When you make edits, the changes will show up here.

4. When you're done making edits, you'll write a short note describing your changes and "commit" them. You can make as many "commits" as you want.

5. You're done making edits, and now ready to pass back your changes to collaborators. You'll issue a "pull request", which alerts others that your changes are ready to be merged into the "master". Hit the pull request button.

*You're done. Alert your collaborators! Repeat these steps every time you have a change to make and you'll be collaborating in the best way possible.*
